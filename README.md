# Excel Project: Bike Sales Dashboard
  
This Excel project visualizes customer demographics and sales data. This dashboard features three charts displaying the average income per purchase, customer age bracket, and customer commute. In addition, the project includes three sliders showing the distribution of customers by marital status, region, and occupation. 

The customer age data were used to create three age brackets: **'Adolescent'** for customers under 30 years old, **'Middle Age'** for customers between 31 and 54 years old, and **'Old'** for customers 55 years old and above, allowing for more meaningful analysis of the customer demographics.
